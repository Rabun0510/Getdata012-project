#Getting and cleaning data
#Course Project

##Project description

The goal of this project was to use the principles taught during this lecture to clean up the supplied dataset.

##Dataset description

The dataset that was supplied for the course project was used for human activity recognition using smartphones and is described as follows:

>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The dataset is composed of a set of files that had to be manipulated in order to obtain the necessary clean dataset.

##Repository details

###Codebook.md
This file contains information about the tidy dataset that was creating using the data as described above. 

###run_analysis.R
This R-script file contains the source code that was written to obtain and clean the given dataset to have an output as required for the course project.

The following files from the original dataset were used. A short description of what information was obtained from each file is given:

 Filename | File content
----------|--------------
features.txt|Names for the each variables
activity_labels.txt|The names for each activity
train/x_train.txt|Dataset that was used for training
train/y_train.txt|Activity labels that correspond to the training dataset
train/subject_train.txt|Subject label for each corresponding observation in training dataset
test/x_test.txt|Dataset that was used for testing
test/y_test.txt|Activity labels that correspond to the test dataset
test/subject_test/txt|Subject label for each corresponding observation in test dataset

The following steps were taken to obtain the tidy dataset:
* The training dataset and corresponding activity and subject labels were read.
* The test dataset and corresponding activity and subject labels were read.
* The names of all the feature variables were read.
* The names of all the activity variables were read.
* The test and train datasets were merged using rbind.
* The dataset column names were changed to the names form the features.txt file (The make.names function was used to create valid names since the original feature names contain invalid characters).
* The select function was used to select only the mean and standard deviation variables of each measurement.
* The subject and activity labels were merged to the dataset using cbind.
* The activity labels were substiduted with the actual names of the activities from the activity_labels.txt file.
* The aggregate function was used to obtain the mean of all the variables for each subject and each activity.
* The output was written to a textfile output.txt.

The code is properly commented so that the implementation of each of the above mentioned steps can be easily seen in the code.
